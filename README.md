# PER-MMO

## Background
The player efficiency rating (PER) is all-in-one basketball rating, which attempts to condense all of a player's contributions into one number. Using a detailed formula, the PER rates every player's statistical performance.

PER takes into account accomplishments, such as field goals, free throws, 3-pointers, assists, rebounds, blocks and steals, and negative results, such as missed shots, turnovers and personal fouls. The formula adds positive stats and subtracts negative ones through a statistical point value system. In the end, one number sums up the players' statistical accomplishments for that season.

## Why a PER for Gaming
Just like in basketball many team online games have many performance statistics to measures the player's contribution. One of the main game genres that historically has relied on such statistics is MMORPG games. Known by their overwhelming interfaces tracking many charts and stats that have become into a meme for "What the hell is going on here"

Games like FF14, World of Warcraft, Star Wars Old Republic & Guild Wars 2 are among titles known to use several statistics to measure the performance of a player. For years it has been a draw back the focus/need for the many addons and systems just to play a game. Its a strong criticism of the genre to be judge by just a number, let it be Item Level (iLvl), Damage done per second (DPS) or Healing done per second (HPS).

The anticipated MMORPG Ashes of Creation has taken another route. The have announced that addons wont be posible in the game, and on top of that, they are not using any of the thritte meters like DPS or HPS. These annoucements have thrown out of their confort zone some raid leaders that ask for a means to manage a raid. It is understandable wanting to have a management system for a leader that must coordinate 20-50 players, lets face it, it is almost imposible to do so without some sort of system to know who is underperforming o who should be substituted for an specific boss figth. 

My middle ground solution is having some type of PER for MMOs. Game developers like AoC want to change the culture of the game, leading into a more social game, meanwhile raid leaders just want to have the tools to help their teams. The game may not need 4-5 meters to track DPS, HPS or Thread, perhaps with just one post-fight meter we can satisfy both needs. I believe having only a PER post-fight meter on instanced dungeons woud be enough for High-end raiders to work with.

### Cultura Jugadores

Culture is part of todays videogame. Dealing with toxicity, Min-Maxers, Casuals, and Bots are among the day to day challenges many developers have to face. Mmorpgs have divided players into casuals and Min-Maxers. The formers are just chilling, using al the "quality of life features" the game offers to achieve the maximum reguard with the minumum effort. Min-maxers on the other hand want to be the best of the best, optimazing their character to the last digit. 

Players have become acustom to not having to know their teammates. Some games have streamlined the whole process of getting to know someone, playing with them, and finally deciding if you want to play with them again. Now its just a button, some interface with a minimum requirment that you're looking for (iLvl, Class, Role) and thats it. You have a new group, that you dont need to interact with and that you don't need to befriend, because the next time you need to find a teammate the game will find it for you.



### Dise√±o desarrolladores

Developers have painted themselves into a corner. Giving player the ability to measure every aspect of their performance has allowed players to demand balance in what the expect their character to perform. DPS classes have to be all equal in the DPS meter. But not all classes play the same, and are not ment just to perform in DPS. For example, a Druid in Wow had the abiity to play as DPS, Tank or Healer, but if a Druid played as a DPS he had an advantage and a disavantage. Druids could be a middle-tier DPS class, therefore they would complaint and ask for the Developers to balance them, resulting in a buff adding mor damage to their class. After this happens, the rest of the DPS Classes would complaint on how Druids could do such damage and at the same time have the ability to heal themselves or to be as flexible as they are. As a result Developers would eventualy give every DPS a healing ability, officialy balancing the issue. You see where I'm going here, Developers end up Hyperbalancing their classes as a result of everyone wanting to be higher in every meter the have acces to.

Most developers want to design classes that are differents, that have several strength and weakness. Some classes maybe more mobile, otheres more resilient, others more pugnent, and at the end there are many facests of design, but there can not be a single meter in game. Having meters can harm the design of video games but its also needed in competitive genres.


### High-end gaming
High-end guids and players really need the data. They need to try and tweak every part of ther character in order to know what gives them the advantage in raiding. Not having any means to measure your performance is detrimental to this player base. 

AoC attepmpts to have a 80%-20% breakdown to Open World versus intanced dungeons/raids. So effectivly high-end raiders woud only have the intanced dungeons as a control environment to perform. I believe having only a PER post-fight meter on instanced dungeons woud be enough for High-end raiders to work with.
